Selected Project Euler problems solely written in C# (from the site https://projecteuler.net/archives )

The problems are:  
26,27,29-39,41-66,67,68,70-78,80-91,95,101,108

Presumably the skipped problems are problems I did with pen and paper (or in another language).

I've included a few extra files that were useful in setting up the solutions (eg, DirectGraph.cs, PrimeGenerator.cs, etc)

These were some of the first C# programs I've written as well as the only C# programs I've written :)
